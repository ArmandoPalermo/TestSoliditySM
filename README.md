# ðŸ”— TestSoliditySM â€“ Web3 Interaction with Smart Contract on Sepolia

This repository contains a simple JavaScript-based test application that demonstrates how to interact dynamically with a **Solidity smart contract** deployed on the **Sepolia testnet** using **Web3.js**.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- Deploys a basic smart contract (`Coin.sol`) written in Solidity
- Connects to the Sepolia testnet via MetaMask
- Allows users to interact with the contract through a simple HTML interface
- Demonstrates reading and writing data on the blockchain
